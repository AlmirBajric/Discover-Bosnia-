            <h1>History of Bosnia and Herzegovina</h1>
            <p>
                Bosnia and Herzegovina, located in the heart of the Balkans, has a history dating back to the Roman era. 
                During the Middle Ages, it was an independent kingdom, known for its religious diversity and trade connections. 
                The Ottoman Empire ruled the region for over 400 years, leaving a significant cultural and architectural legacy, 
                including mosques, bridges, and bazaars.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 19th century, Bosnia came under Austro-Hungarian rule, which modernized infrastructure and education 
                but also intensified national movements. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 
                sparked World War I, marking Bosnia’s pivotal role in global history. After World War II, Bosnia became part 
                of socialist Yugoslavia until its independence in 1992. Despite facing a devastating war, the country has 
                rebuilt and emerged as a symbol of resilience.

            <p>
                Bosnia and Herzegovina’s culture reflects a unique blend of East and West. Its traditions are deeply rooted 
                in its diverse heritage, shaped by Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, and Slavic influences. The country is known 
                for its rich folklore, traditional music, and festivals.

            <p>
                The cuisine is a highlight of Bosnian culture, with dishes like <em>cevapi</em> (grilled minced meat sausages), 
                <em>burek</em> (savory pastry filled with meat or cheese), and <em>sarma</em> (stuffed cabbage rolls). Coffee culture 
                is also significant, with Bosnian coffee served in traditional <em>dzezva</em> pots being a symbol of hospitality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Art and literature thrive in Bosnia, with the Sarajevo Film Festival being one of the most renowned cultural 
                events in Southeast Europe. Traditional crafts, such as carpet weaving and copperwork, are still practiced 
                in many towns, preserving Bosnia’s artisanal heritage.
